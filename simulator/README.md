The source of uncertainty is related to other agents intents and driving models.  
  
Depending on:  
* an agent intent  
* an agent driving or behavioral model  
* and contextual information (relative positions, speeds, geometry of the scene, rules and signalling)     
  
An agent in the scene will modify its acceleration. Predicting or anticipating how the surrounding agents could potentially modify their acceleration in the short-term future (up to a few seconds) is of paramount importance for safe driving.
