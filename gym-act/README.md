The [Anti Collision Tests (ACT) environment](https://github.com/PhilippeW83440/CS234_Project/tree/master/act-env) is a driver agent
task featuring continuous state and action spaces. The driver agent is pursuing multiple objectives;Â efficiency (time to goal shall be minimized), comfort (the number of hard braking decisions shall be minimized) and safety (collisions shall be avoided) shall be optimized; while the Driver Models of other cars in the scene are the main source of uncertainty to deal with.
